        "description": "As you swing open the creaky Wild West bank doors, the once charming scene has turned chaotic. Dust particles dance in the sunlight that now reveals an armed delinquent, their face hidden beneath a bandana, corralling frightened citizens. The grizzled bank teller, beads of sweat forming on his forehead, reluctantly assists the criminals. The worn wooden counters, now cluttered with overturned inkwells and scattered papers, bear the scars of the sudden upheaval. The vault door, usually a symbol of security, now looms ominously in the background, a canvas for wanted posters flapping in the uneasy breeze.",
